# LED Video Converter

This is a python script that is meant to convert and resize video files to a format that can be fed
into an Arduino LED array. LED on will be 255, and LED off is 0. There is no in-between.

## Additional Features:
This script also converts any video file into grayscale before any conversions.
It also tries clean up any dark/light gray colors by forcing them to be black or white.
